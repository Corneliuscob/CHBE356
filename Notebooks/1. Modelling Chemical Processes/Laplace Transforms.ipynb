    "The Laplace transform is a mathematical operation that maps a function in the time domain $ f(t) $ to the complex frequency domain $ F(s) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "In process control, the Laplace transform is commonly used as a tool to transform ordinary differential equations into algebraic problems, where solutions can be easily found.\n",

    "$$ F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\int^{\\infty}_{0}{e^{-st}f(t) dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ is a complex variable with a real and imaginary part, $s = \\sigma + i\\omega$, as opposed to $t$, which is a real variable."
