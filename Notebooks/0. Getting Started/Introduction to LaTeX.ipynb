    "# Introduction to LaTeX\n",
    "\n",
    "LaTeX (pronounced *Lay-Tech*) is a document preparation system that creates beautiful documents and makes it easy to write mathematical equations. Nearly all process control, computer science and math research papers are written using $\\LaTeX$ (notice the stylized text, this is done with LaTeX).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learn LaTeX\n",
    "\n",
    "LaTeX allows you to write your content first and handle the document's design later with a programmatic and consistent approach. Recall all your sleepless nights in CHBE, fighting with Microsoft Word over the formatting of your lab reports. LaTeX solves those problems by allowing you to focus on the report's content and generate the final formatted document using a template."

    "\n",
    "To write LaTeX in Jupyter, make sure your cell is in Markdown mode first. You can then write LaTeX expressions by enclosing them in single dollar signs. For example, writing `$ax+b=c$` would give you $ax+b=c$. This is called inline math mode.\n",

    "You can also have your equations on a separate line by enclosing them in double dollar signs. For example, writing `$$y=mx+b$$` would give you:\n",
